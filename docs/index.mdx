### Markdown for the component era:

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX within Markdown
documents. You can very easily import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and
embed them within your Markdown content. This makes the transition of writing long-form 
content within components smooth and easy.

#### Try it on your own:

```.mdx
# Hello, *world*!

Below we have an example of JSX embedded within a Markdown. <br /> **Try and change
the background color!**

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>I am wrapped inside JSX</h3>
</div>
```

:muscle: **Powerful**: MDX can help you with your JSX-based projects by perfectly fitting JSX 
and markdown together to work seamlessly.

:computer: **Everything is a component**: As easy as importing a JSX component and rendering them
directly within your MDX document.

:wrench: **Easy customization**: Flexibility to decide which component gets rendered for each markdown
element.

:books: **Markdown-based**: With the simplicity and elegance of Markdown,
you can decide and interleave JSX only when you want to.

:zap: **Blazingly fast**: MDX has no runtime; compilation occurs
during the build stage.

## Why MDX?

Before the advent of MDX, some of the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrated with JSX. 
The implementations were often template string-based that required lots of escaping and cumbersome syntax.

MDX incorporates writing Markdown _within_ JSX simple and expressive. 
Writing is just more fun when we can combine components that can load dynamic data 
and display long-form content using the simple syntax structure of Markdown.
